# Quickstart for local Starport installation

Now that `starport` is installed on your machine, you can build your very first blockchain! <!-- or do we want to write for gitpod too? -->

To build a blockchain:

```
```

The `app` command creates the directory `myapp` and scaffolds a Cosmos SDK blockchain.

To run your blockchain:

```
starport serve
```

The `serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain.

To update functionality for a custom type:

```
starport type post title body
```

The `type` command scaffolds functionality to create, read, update, and delete for a custom type.

<!-- what is a type? why do we need custom types? -->
