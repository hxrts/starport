# UI on Github Pages

<!-- what is the purpose of this content? deferring edit until I understand more. I do not see GitHub pages in my settings. If we keep, I need more context --> Click the link below, and scroll down until you see it get her pages. Then, select the branch gh-pages.

Github Pages Settings: <https://github.com/{username}/{repository}/settings/>

After you do that you can visit your chain's UI at:

<https://{username}.github.io/{repository}>

This is especially useful when you would like to rapidly iterate on a live user interface. Remember, each community member can have their own github pages instance, allowing your community to mix-and-match front ends.
