# About Starport

Starport is a developer-friendly interface to the Cosmos SDK.

## What is Starport?

The Starport tool is the easiest way to create blockchains using the Tendermint Consensus engine and the Cosmos SDK.

With just a few commands, you can use Starport to:

1. Create a blockchain
2. Launch a blockchain
3. Create a client-side app you can interact with in a web browser

Starport and the SDK modules are written in the Go programming language. Starport creates a user interface with Vue.js. This user interface provides a good starting point for developers by creating a browser-based client-side app for your blockchain. The scaffolded app created with Starport includes a command line interface that lets you manage keys, create validators, and send tokens.

Starport replaces the `scaffold` program that was previously used to create a blockchain app.

## Projects using Tendermint and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT Consensus Engine and the Cosmos SDK. For the full list, explore the [Cosmos Network Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets, and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Cosmos SDK Modules

[Cosmos SDK modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/) are the foundational building blocks for building a blockchain. The Cosmos SDK offers a variety of native modules to make a blockchain work. Modules can be created and shared with anyone. When you use Starport to add Cosmos SDK modules, the code edits and additions are managed.

## Summary

- Starport lets you create, develop, and build a blockchain.

- Starport and Cosmos SDK modules are written in Go.

- You can use different Cosmos SDK modules to customize their blockchain.
